																	<strong>How to make a t shirt longer</strong>. 
								
																	This was a fast an easy solution to turning a short sleeve t shirt into a long sleeve t shirt for winter. 
																	This t shirt vest is unbelievably easy to make and it can be layered over anything from a dress to a long sleeve tee. 
																	Cut along the lines you drew and either leave the edges raw or hem them for a neater finish. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So the shirt does not go into the trash. 
																	Add length to a shirt with a little help from a second shirt you no longer wear. 
																	And there is absolutely no sewing involved. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Fold your t shirt in half vertically with the front half of the t shirt on the outside. 
																	I loved the idea that it fit my husband so we are making more of these this year. 
																	Put on the shirt that is too small. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To modify a t shirt to make it cuter try cutting the collar off to make a scoop neck. 
																	I have already tossed all of the ones i no longer wanted but i held onto the lovely holiday tees with bling designs or even simple designs all too pretty to let go of. 
																	As someone else mentioned t shirts sold a few years ago were shorter than the longer or tunic length i prefer now. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A bunch of her long sleeved t shirts were getting much too short when i had the idea to modify them in this way but in the time it took me to get to my sewing machine spring has made a pretty convincing appearance it was 78 yesterday so i decided to try it on a short sleeved shirt instead. 
																	Press with your iron and take it to the sewing machine. 
																	First trace around the front collar with 2 inches added to the sides and 1 inch on the bottom. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I hope this will make it last a little longer. 
																	I will need to make him some shirts that he can wear out and about but this works for working in the yard and around the house. 
																	Use your straight pins to start pinning the seam lines.
