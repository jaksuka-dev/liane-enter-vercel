																	<strong>What does the t in t shirt stand for</strong>. 
								
																	T shirt t shirt is a 1976 album by loudon wainwright iii. 
																	A t shirt has a straight body with sleeves at the top that make the form of the letter t hence the name t shirt while similar types of cotton undershirts were worn prior to the t shirt they were all sleeveless varieties so were not really t shaped shirts or t shirts at all. 
																	I t may refer to the shape of the shirt as a t when laid out it looks like the alphabet t. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If the shirt in question were meant to be used primarily with outstretched arms in long sleeves it might be known as a y shirt. 
																	An outer shirt of a design similar to the t shirt. 
																	Unlike his earlier records this saw wainwright adopt a full blown rock band though there are acoustic songs on t shirt including a talking blues. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Traditionally it has short sleeves and a round neckline known as a crew neck which lacks a collar t shirts are generally made of a stretchy light and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean. 
																	Nevertheless it had the misfortune to arrive on the scene at the same time as punk rock making it immediately dated in the eyes of many. 
																	The origin is uncertain. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A short sleeved collarless undershirt. 
																	The shape based theory is supported by the existence of an a shirt in the 1930s which was a typical undershirt and later referred to as a tank top. 
																	The letter t looks like a short sleeved shirt with no collar. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It may be derived from its use by the army as a training shirt. 
																	The t was never meant to stand for anything the etymology is based on the shape of a t shirt when it s laid flat and. 
																	If the shirt was designed as a restraining device with hands locked into a waist chain it could be called an i shirt or straight jacket.
