					<p align="justify">Always play fair if you have a great idea for a t shirt that involves the use of an image from a copyrighted movie tv show or computer game and you think the product would market well then contact the copyright owner and ask to have or buy a limited permission to use the image on your t shirts. So a famous painting or photograph of any of the above falls under the same. This can be done electronically or through mail. <br>
